# toDoList

1) Using Express, write a server that implements a todo list. (You may use the todo-list server you implemented last class).
2) Create a /public subfolder, and use express.static() to server a website from /public or create a templates folder and build your front-end to be served by render templates
3) Implement a Todo-list website (keep the UI simple!)
4) Users on your Todo-list website should be able to:
add todos
delete todos
mark todos as "completed"
edit the text for a todo
5) Your website should interact with your API to manage the todo-list state. The todo list that your website renders should always be in sync with the API's todo list!
6) Push your solution to github and comment below with your github URL
